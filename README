Fu-fu: The Profanity Filter for Rails
===============

This plugin will allow you to filter profanity using basic replacement or a dictionary term.

Example
=======

You can use it in your models:

  Notice -- there are two profanity filters, one is destructive.  Beware the exclamation point (profanity_filter!).

  Non-Destructive (filters content when called, original text remains in the database)

    profanity_filter :foo, :bar
      # banned words will be replaced with @#$%
    profanity_filter :foo, :bar, :method => 'dictionary'
      # banned words will have their vowels replaced

    The non-destructive profanity_filter provides different versions of the filtered attribute:
      some_model.foo => 'filtered version'
      some_model.foo_original => 'non-filtered version'

  Destructive (saves the filtered content to the database)

    profanity_filter! :foo, :bar
      # banned words will be replaced with @#$%
    profanity_filter! :foo, :bar, :method => 'dictionary'
      # banned words will have their vowels replaced

You can also use the filter directly:

  ProfanityFilter::Base.clean(text)
  ProfanityFilter::Base.clean(text, 'dictionary')


TODO
====

This plugin is not currently filtering words that are punctuation delimited (ex. 'f-u-c-k').
